# Customer Segmentation (Clustering)

A project for performing customer segmentation using clustering algorithms (unsupervised learning) on the Mall Customers dataset.

---

## 📁 Files & Structure

| File | Description |
|---|---|
| `Mall_Customers.csv` | Dataset containing customer data (e.g. annual income, spending score, etc.). |
| `app.py` | Main application script, likely builds a model and/or serves a UI (possibly via Streamlit) to interact with segmentation results. |

---

## 🧮 Features

- Data loading and preprocessing of mall customer data  
- Clustering customers into segments based on features such as income, spending patterns, etc.  
- Visualization of clusters  
- Interactive application to explore clusters (if using Streamlit or similar)

---

## 🛠️ Requirements

Make sure you’re running inside a Python virtual environment. Here are the packages you would need:

- `pandas`  
- `numpy`  
- `scikit-learn`  
- `matplotlib` / `seaborn` (for visualizations)  
- `streamlit` (if `app.py` uses Streamlit for UI)  
- Other dependencies as needed (e.g. for model persistence, etc.)

## 🚀 Setup & Installation

1. **Clone the repo**  
   ```bash



   python -m venv .venv
# On Windows
.venv\Scripts\activate
# On macOS/Linux
source .venv/bin/activate


pip install -r requirements.txt


python -m streamlit run app.py



🧭 How to Use

Load the data from Mall_Customers.csv.

Perform exploratory data analysis to understand distributions, missing values, correlations.

Choose clustering techniques (K-Means, Hierarchical, DBSCAN, etc.).

Fit the model and determine optimal number of clusters (e.g. via elbow method, silhouette score).

Visualize the clusters.

Use app.py to allow interactive exploration of clusters (e.g. select feature, show plots, etc.).

🔍 Possible Extensions

Apply feature scaling to improve clustering performance

Try different clustering algorithms and compare results

Use dimensionality reduction (PCA, t-SNE) for visualization

Add cluster profiling — understanding what each cluster represents (age, income, spending score, etc.)

Deploy the app (e.g. on Heroku, Streamlit Cloud) for shareable access

⚠️ Notes & Known Issues

Make sure correct imports are used (e.g. if using newer versions of libraries such as LangChain, ensure proper modules are installed)

Large datasets may slow clustering computations

Streamlit needs to be installed, or you may get “command not found” errors
